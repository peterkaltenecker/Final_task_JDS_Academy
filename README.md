The final assignment involved a fictitious online business known as Dilan's blog.\
Dilan travels around the world, writes a blog about it and sells two products related to his global travels: an e-book and a video course.
His blog covers the six main continents of the world, is accessible from eight countries, and has readers from three different sources. His current marketing budget is allocated to these three sources.

The question was how Dilan could invest more work, time and money into his blog in the most effective way possible to make it bigger, better and more profitable.
