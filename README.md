This was the final task/exam of a 3 months long data science course at Junior Data Science Academy (from February to April 2023).

The task was about an imaginery online business, Dilan's blog.
Dilan travels around the world, writes a blog about it and sells two related products: an e-book and a video course.
His blog covers the 6 main continents of the world, it is available to read in 8 countries and his readers come from 3 sources. His current marketing budget is spent on these 3 sources.
The question was: how could Dilan invest more work, time and money into his blog on the most efficient way in order to make it bigger, better and more profitable?
